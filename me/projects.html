    <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>This just one project of many that I have worked on throughout this EVSC school year. This is a block based project that took your first name, last name, city, and parents name. Then it takes all of the inputs you put in and mix the letters together. To give you your first and last name in sci fi. I couldn't have done it without SICTC so here is the link to give the school credit: <a href="https://sictc.evscschools.com">Southern Indiana Career and Technical Center</a></p>

        <p>Since there is only a few projects on my website here is a link for a few more: <a href="https://github.com/cbaylor2004/Projects">My Github Repo</a></p>

        <p>I wouldn't have had this amazing opportunity at the tech school without my home school Gibson Southern High School. Here is there amazing well built out website:<a href="https://gshs.sgibson.k12.in.us/">Gibson Southern High School</a></p>
